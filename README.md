# GPT-Toolbox
GPT extension for VSCode. 
Generic interface and queries to use with Chat-GPT.
Main feature is documenting selected code.
With more functionalities expected to land in this project.

## Disclaimers:

> :warning: **Code sent and chat API host**: The selected code will be sent to the ChatGPT host. Make sure you are allowed to do so. If your code is private, you may not have the rights to send it to a 3rd Party. 

This extension has been tested mostly on Typescript code. Documentation quality with other languages may vary.

## Running this extension

- Run `npm install` in terminal to install dependencies
- Run the `Run Extension` target in the Debug View. This will:
	- Start a task `npm: watch` to compile the code
	- Run the extension in a new VS Code window
